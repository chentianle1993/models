# TensorFlow Models
### 参考：  [《TensorFlow实战》与《TensorFlow实战Google深度学习框架》对比认识](http://blog.csdn.net/h4565445654/article/details/71241836)

This repository contains a number of different models implemented in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org):

The [official models （官方使用tf的顶层API，初学者使用）](official) are a collection of example models that use TensorFlow's high-level APIs. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable TensorFlow API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read. We especially recommend newer TensorFlow users to start here.

The [research models （个体户创建，不保证正确）](research) are a large collection of models implemented in TensorFlow by researchers. It is up to the individual researchers to maintain the models and/or provide support on issues and pull requests.

The [samples folder （小网络）](samples) contains code snippets and smaller models that demonstrate features of TensorFlow, including code presented in various blog posts.

The [tutorials folder （官方tutorial上的示例）](tutorials) is a collection of models described in the [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).
